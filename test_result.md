## Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing Needed**: Since browser automation failed, manual testing should be performed to verify:
   - UI interactions work correctly
   - Chat responses are appropriate
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - All buttons and links function properly

2. **Server Accessibility**: Verify the application is accessible from the intended URL for end users

## Issues Identified

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Found:
1. **Server Compilation Issues**: The Next.js server appears to have compilation problems and is not responding to HTTP requests properly
2. **Potential Build Errors**: Server logs show compilation is stuck or failing
3. **Browser Testing Blocked**: Cannot perform full UI testing due to server accessibility issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues:
1. **Dependency Problems**: May need to run `npm install` to resolve dependencies
2. **Port Conflicts**: Server trying to use port 3000 first, falling back to 3001
3. **Environment Configuration**: May need proper environment setup

## Recommendations for Main Agent

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Server Issues**: 
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check for any compilation errors in the build process
   - Ensure the server can properly serve the application

2. **Verify Application Functionality**:
   - Once server is fixed, manually test all homepage elements
   - Test chat functionality and AI responses
   - Verify all navigation works properly

3. **Content Verification Needed**:
   - The human mentioned seeing "tokumo images and photos" which suggests there might still be references to the old content
   - Need to verify all images and content are properly updated to Rahman's information

## Overall Assessment
**Status**: ‚ùå **NEEDS FIXING** 

While the code structure appears correct based on review, the application is not currently functional due to server compilation issues. The server needs to be fixed before proper testing can be completed.
